**SplashKit Beach** is a collection of games made with the SplashKit SDK, designed for use with the **Arcade Machine**. This repository serves as a central hub, linking to individual game repositories and providing access to both stable and development versions of community-created games.

## Branches

- **`main` branch**: Contains the "stable" versions of games that are fully playable and have been tested for deployment. These games are ready for players to enjoy.
- **`dev` branch**: Houses "beta" versions of games that are still in development or undergoing testing. While playable, these games may be incomplete or have features in progress.

## Linked Repositories

Each game within SplashKit Beach is stored in its own repository and linked to this main collection. The individual repositories include details on gameplay, controls, and setup instructions. For information on how to play each game, refer to the README files within the respective game repositories.

## Getting Started

To play the games, youâ€™ll need to install the SplashKit SDK. Follow the [SplashKit Installation Guide](https://splashkit.io/installation/) for setup instructions on your system. Once you have SplashKit installed, you can clone the SplashKit Beach repository and run the games, as detailed in the README or Documentation files of the individual game repositories.

## Contributing

SplashKit Beach is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Games under development can be found in the `dev` branch, and we encourage developers to contribute to these projects by submitting pull requests.
